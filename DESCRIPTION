Description: The package contains two principal tools for the triadic analysis
    of affiliation networks: the triad census and the clustering coefficient.
    The former includes several variations; the latter involves a shell that
    uses any of several notions of wedge and wedge closure. Assorted additional
    functions, including a measure of dynamic triadic closure, are available for
    affiliation network manipulation.
