Description: The package contains two principal tools for the triadic analysis
    of affiliation networks: the triad census and the clustering coefficient.
    The former has several forms (full, uniformity, structural, simple) and the
    latter calls one of several definitions of wedge (watts.strogatz, opsahl,
    exclusive, and miscellaneous others) and attendant definitions of closure.
