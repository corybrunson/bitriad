Description: This package implements two principal tools for the triadic
    analysis of affiliation networks: triad census and triadic closure.
    The package includes several variations on both classical tools, tailored
    to affiliation network structure. Assorted additional functions are
    included for affiliation network manipulation. The package is built on the
    igraph package but includes new graph-theoretic calculations written using
    the Rcpp package.
