Description: The package contains two principal tools for the triadic analysis
    of static affiliation networks: the triad census and the clustering
    coefficient (transitivity). The former has several forms (full, structural,
    simple) and the latter calls one of several definitions of wedge and of
    closure. The next step is to extend the package to time-resolved networks.
