#' Wedges
#' 
#' Each clustering coefficient can be defined as the proportion of "wedges" that
#' are "closed", for suitable definitions of both terms. These functions count
#' the "wedges", and among them the "closed" ones, centered at a given actor
#' node in a given affiliation network.
#' @param bigraph The ambient affiliation network.
#' @param Q An actor node in the network.
