\usage{
edge.weight(graph, vp)

\arguments{
\item{graph}{A one-mode network (used as the one-mode projection of bigraph)}

\item{vp}{Ids of vertex pair, the edge between which is being considered}

\item{bigraph}{The ambient affiliation network}

\item{vids}{Vertex ids, the event count among which is being considered}

\item{v}{A subset of actor node ids.}
}
\description{

induced subgraph on the actor nodes together with all event nodes incident
to at least two of the actor nodes.
