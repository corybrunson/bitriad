\usage{
se.triad.census(bigraph, type = 0, verbose = FALSE)

\description{
This function computes the structural triad census for an affiliation
network, a 4-by-2 array of frequency counts for each isomorphism class of
triad, modulo an equivalence relation of event nodes by which actors they
are tied to, which sum to choose(n, 3), where n is the number of actor nodes.
